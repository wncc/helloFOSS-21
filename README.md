## Open Source Projects for Social Good By the Web & Coding Club IIT Bombay


Hello There!   

Hello FOSS is a *festival* organised by [WnCC](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/), IITB to encourage the culture of Open Source in our insti. We promise there's something for everyone. Okay, time for some background before getting started.    
There's this initiative called [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) by Digital Ocean all over the world to encourage participation in the open source community. There's a challenge, on whose completion they award you with either a t-shirt or get a tree planted on your name. We wanted to help y'all get started with Open Source, but given the academic load this semester, thought that now might not be a good time. But, with Hacktoberfest running along side, we hope your enthusiasm to learn Open Source fueled by the motivation to complete this year's challenge, this might turn out to be a successful endeavour afterall.  

Open Source can be daunting at first, How would I get started? Will they accept me? Will ..anyone accept me?    
Relax! If you're clueless, watch this recent introductory session by us - [Panel Discussion with GSoCers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W74Ky0kdlFU)

## Active Projects 

Under this initiative Hello FOSS, we bring to you various projects from diverse fields which you can contribute to and start your open source journey. To begin with, listed below are the projects that are being launched. We will soon be adding more projects to help you get started easily with projects that match your skills. Choose your field of interest and get started!

1. [BashForGood](https://github.com/wncc/helloFOSS-21-BashForGood) : Using UNIX's own *Bourne again shell* for Personal Encryption, Automating File Downloads, Github Push-Pull and much more!
2. [Contributive Programming](https://github.com/wncc/helloFOSS-21-ContributiveProgramming) : A different definition to CP. Learn, Contrive and code solutions to problems towards a noble cause. The topics range from Minimum Stack, Number Theory and Dynamic Programming to Disjoint Set Union, Lowest Common Ancestor and Sweep-Line Algorithms.
3. [LifeAudit: Simulation of Life in an online semester](https://github.com/wncc/helloFOSS-21-LifeAudit) : Online semeseter has been sucking the joy out of our college life since the past 1-2 years for many of us. We all must have felt depressed, demotivated many times during this period. This simulation is an attempt to analyze if we managed our time well, set better priorities could we utilize this any better? Its an interesting way to explore and see what works best for us even in such a situation.
4. [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://github.com/wncc/helloFOSS-21-Intro-to-ML) : Various small projects to introduce you to the exciting domain of Machine Learning. Absolutely no prerequisites required!! Learn from the slides shared in the repository and contribute!
